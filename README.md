## ruby_chess

**NOTE:** Unfortunately this project is definitely not finished. As mentioned to some, when we did the chess exercise in class my partner and I didn't get that far, so as of now I still have a bit to do to get the basic functionality working (though I'm almost there), then I can refactor and add a real README.
